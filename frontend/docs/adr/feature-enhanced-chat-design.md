# ADR: Enhanced Real-time Chat System

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The current chat implementation is partially complete and requires real-time messaging, file sharing, message reactions, typing indicators, and enhanced UX to meet P0 requirements.

## Decision
Implement a comprehensive real-time chat system using:
- Supabase Realtime for WebSocket connections
- React Query for optimistic updates
- Drag-and-drop file upload with progress tracking
- Message reactions with emoji picker
- Typing indicators and read receipts

## Consequences
- Improved user engagement through real-time features
- Enhanced collaboration capabilities
- Better file sharing workflow
- Increased system complexity requiring robust error handling
